# Fortune Wheel in Unity 3D

There are a roulette wheel and its launch button on the screen.

By pressing the start button, a player spins the roulette, and after a while it slows down, stopping at one of its elements.

In the Unity Inspector window, you can set up the following options:

<ul>
<li>Number of wheel sectors</li>
<li>An array of roulette elements with their parameters (image, dropout probability)</li>
<li>Time to full acceleration of the roulette wheel</li>
<li>The maximum speed of rotation</li>
<li>Rotation time at maximum speed (before deceleration)</li>
<li>Time until the roulette wheel stops after determining the element to select</li>
<li>The ability to force the dropout of a specific element</li>
</ul>
